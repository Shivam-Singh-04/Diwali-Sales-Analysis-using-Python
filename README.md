# Diwali-Sales-Analysis-using-Python

The problem statement was to analyze and provide meaningful insights to an e-commerce store owner for Diwali Sales. Once again, Python was used since it's structure and syntax is easy for a beginner to understand and it provides various libraries which play a crucial role in Data Visualization and Data Analytics.



The Libraries used in the project are:

● NumPy: Used to perform mathematical and logical operations on arrays.

● Pandas: Powerful, Fast and Flexible library for Data Analysis, manipulating and filtering.

● Matplotlib: Comprehensive library for creating static, interactive and animated visualizations.

● Seaborn: It is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.



The first step was to do Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the data to investigate and summarize the key insights. It will give us a basic understanding of our data, it's distribution, null values and much more explained in detail in the Jupyter Notebook. After visualizing all the categories, we came to a conclusion as per the data.



Final Insight: Married women from the age group 26-35 years from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka working in IT sector, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products food, clothing & apparel and electronics & gadgets category.

My learning in this project are as follows:

1) Performed data cleaning and manipulation.

2) Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

3) Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.

4) Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.
